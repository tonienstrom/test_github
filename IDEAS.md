A Theo Jansen style walker/strandbeest made with a laser cutter.
<br/><br/>
Jansen's walker thingies look complex, but functional copies of them have already been made from lego bricks too.<br/>

Building instructions (for lego model): <a href="http://www.aupress.ca/books/120175/ebook/05_Dawson_et_al_2010-From_Bricks_To_Brains.pdf">pdf-file</a><br/>
Page 24 has a picture of how the proportions of a leg should be.
<br/><br/>
I'm not sure, but think a similar walkable strandbeest could be made with laser printer, by cutting carefully measured parts out of wood or plastic. This can be complex project, though.
